# Project N.O.M.A.D.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Rules

You are working in the same repo as another coding agent (Codex). Do not revert unrelated changes. Do not use `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git clean -fd`, or delete files just because they look untracked or generated. Read the current `git diff` before editing, keep changes scoped to the requested task, and avoid files already being touched unless necessary. If a file is already modified, preserve existing edits and work with them.

### Branch & Workflow
- `master` is current and synced with `origin/master`.
- Pull / re-read `git status` and `git diff` before each task.
- Commit small, focused changes. One logical change per commit.
- If both agents need the same file, let one finish first.
- Leave `tmp/` alone unless explicitly asked.

### Protected Files (Do Not Delete)
These are intentional repo assets, not junk:
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` — frontend tooling
- `esbuild.config.mjs` — JS bundler config
- `playwright.config.mjs` — UI test config
- `tests/ui/shell-workflows.spec.mjs` — Playwright UI tests
- `tools/build_offline_atlas.py` — offline basemap generator
- `web/nukemap/data/offline_atlas.json` — shared offline atlas (NukeMap + VIPTrack)
- `web/viptrack/lib/` — vendored Leaflet + pako for VIPTrack (referenced by tracked index.html)
- `web/checklist_templates_data.py` — imported by `web/blueprints/checklists.py`
- `docs/` — project documentation

## Audit History (12 rounds)
- **v7.0.5 — Print Refactor + Cross-module Dashboard**: Third pass at the Top 20 design-review list.
  - **`print_routes.py` partial refactor (item #20)**: Extracted 8 shared helpers — `_fetch_contacts()`, `_fetch_burn_summary()`, `_fetch_low_stock()`, `_fetch_expiring()`, `_render_contacts_table()`, `_render_burn_table()`, `_render_low_stock_table()`, `_render_expiring_table()`, `_render_standard_frequencies_table()` + a shared `STANDARD_FREQUENCIES` constant. Refactored `api_preparedness_print` to use them: 131 lines of hand-built HTML collapsed to ~40. Identical output verified via test suite. Other print routes can migrate to the same helpers in follow-up sprints without changing visual output.
  - **New `/api/preparedness/dashboard` endpoint**: Cross-module operational snapshot requested by the Preparedness design review. Returns one JSON payload with `inventory` / `medical` / `power` / `garden` / `contacts` / `tasks` / `incidents` / `alerts` / `readiness_hint` sections so Home and Preparedness Overview can render a "daily standup" without seven separate fetches. Every section is wrapped in try/except so a partial schema / fresh install / missing optional table (e.g. `power_log`) returns 200 with that section marked unavailable rather than 500. Coarse `readiness_hint` flips to `needs-attention` on any low stock / expiring items / overdue tasks / critical alerts / critical incidents. Three integration tests added in `tests/test_incidents.py::TestPreparednessDashboard`.
  - **Design-review false positive**: Library tier installed indicator is already implemented at `_app_workspace_memory.js:2468` — the "tier selection state invisible" finding was wrong. The `loadWikipediaTiers()` function already renders a `✓ Installed` badge on every installed tier.
  - **Parallel-agent convergence**: the benchmark concurrent-run guard and the situation-room skeleton re-wipe fix I had carried as uncommitted working-tree changes after v7.0.4 were independently shipped by the Codex agent as commit `595baef` ("Audit round 2"). My stash unwound cleanly because the diffs were already upstream.
  - **Tests**: 839 pytest tests pass locally (836 previous + 3 new for the dashboard endpoint).
- **v7.0.4 — Design Review UX Round 2**: Second pass at the Top 20 design-review list, focused on tab-isolated wins outside Codex's parallel shell-hardening work:
  - **`benchmark.py` + `_app_workspaces.js` + `_tab_benchmark.html`**: Benchmark rebranded as "System Health Check". Backend now produces an A–F letter grade per subsystem (CPU / memory / disk / AI / response), an overall health grade, and a model recommendation computed from RAM + GPU + measured tok/s via the new `_interpret_results()` / `_recommend_model()` helpers in `benchmark.py`. The renderer in `showBenchResults()` shows letter grades + a "Recommended model" card first; raw scores moved into a collapsible `<details>` for power users. Addresses the review finding that the old UI exposed TTFT/tokens/sec/CPU-ops to end users who couldn't interpret them.
  - **`_app_situation_room.js` + `45_situation_room.css`**: Skeleton placeholders on Situation Room refresh. `_showSitroomSkeletons()` injects pulse-animated placeholder rows into every empty sitroom card body the moment a refresh starts, so users get an immediate "working" signal instead of staring at blank cards for 30-60s while 34 fetch workers complete. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - **`media.py api_media_search`** (new route) + `_tab_media.html` + `_app_media_maps_sync.js` + `_app_shell_router.js` + `20_workspaces.css`: Unified cross-catalog media search. New `/api/media/search?q=…` endpoint runs a case-insensitive LIKE across `videos`, `audio`, `books` tables + the in-memory `CHANNEL_CATALOG`, returns normalised `{type, id, title, subtitle}` results with exact-match → prefix → contains ranking. A search input with a debounced 200ms dropdown now lives in the Media command-deck header, with request-id guards for stale-response collapse and a click-to-jump handler (`mediaCrossSearchOpen`) that switches to the appropriate sub-tab. Solves the "700+ items but no way to search across them" finding.
  - **`30_preparedness_ops.css`**: Inventory table → card fallback below 768px. The 10-column inventory table reflows into a grid-based card per row: Name as bold title, actions pinned right, Category/Qty/Days/Expires as a chip cluster underneath, and Cost/Location/Lot/Notes as a collapsed meta row (hidden when empty). Row tone (`inventory-row-alert` / `-risk` / `-watch`) becomes a left border on mobile. Qty stepper buttons bumped to 36×36px to meet touch-target guidance.
  - **CSS focus contract**: `test_css_focus_contract_does_not_regress_to_outline_none` caught two new `outline: none` declarations in the cross-search input and result row; replaced with `:focus-visible` that relies on box-shadow instead.
  - **Tests**: 836 pytest tests pass locally.
  - **Remaining Top 20 items deferred**: h1 heading hierarchy, form labels, modal focus trap, mobile hamburger, UI zoom spacing scale, monolith splits (`situation_room.py` 5432 → 5 blueprints, `_app_workspace_memory.js` 2912 → code-split), real-time status strip subscription, full i18n expansion — these touch the shell and are being handled by the Codex agent in parallel.
- **v7.0.3 — Design Review Hardening**: Six parallel design/UX/implementation reviews (Situation Room, Preparedness, Media/Maps/Library/Notes, Home/Services/AI/Settings, Tools/Benchmark/Print, Shell/A11y/i18n) produced a consolidated top‑20 improvement list. Highest‑priority CRITICAL + MAJOR fixes applied:
  - **`web/blueprints/services.py api_update_download`** — update downloads are now SHA256-verified against `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same release asset set. A missing or mismatched checksum deletes the downloaded file and surfaces an error. Eliminates supply‑chain risk on auto-update. The release workflow already publishes `SHA256SUMS.txt` via `sha256sum * > SHA256SUMS.txt` in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
  - **`web/blueprints/ai.py api_ai_execute_action`** — refactored into `_parse_ai_action(action)` + two‑phase commit. Without `confirmed: true` the endpoint now returns a preview (`status: "preview"`) describing exactly what would happen; mutation only occurs when the frontend re-POSTs with `confirmed: true`. Prevents hallucinated AI writes from silently creating inventory/incident/note/waypoint rows.
  - **`web/blueprints/system.py api_backups_restore`** — two‑phase commit added. Without `confirmed: true` the endpoint returns a preview (`size_bytes`, `current_db_will_be_backed_up`). Auto-backup of current DB still runs on confirmed restore. Prevents accidental data loss from a misclicked backup filename.
  - **`web/blueprints/maps.py api_waypoints_import_gpx`** — added `GPX_MAX_BYTES = 50 MB` and `GPX_MAX_WAYPOINTS = 10000` caps; streams size check before reading into memory; refuses non-GPX root elements; validates lat/lng ranges; caps name length at 200 chars. Prevents hang/DoS on malformed or oversized GPX files.
  - **`_tab_readiness.html`** — added a "Generate AI SITREP" button to the Readiness panel actions so the flagship AI feature is discoverable outside the Preparedness > Command Post sub-tab.
  - **`_tab_library.html` + `_app_services_ai.js loadZimList()`** — added a Kiwix pre‑flight banner that surfaces when zero ZIMs are installed, explaining that Kiwix needs content to start and providing a one-click Install Essentials button. Eliminates the cryptic "service failed to start" error path.
  - **Design review false positives (verified, no fix needed)**: default landing IS already Home (`@app.route('/')` → `_render_workspace_page('services')` at `web/app.py:432-434`); signals/protocols/reference prep tabs ARE implemented inside `_weather.html` and `_guides.html` (not missing templates); `execute-action` endpoint only supports additive INSERTs (no delete/update patterns) so the "destructive AI" concern was overstated, but the consent flag was added anyway as defense-in-depth.

## Audit History (9 rounds)
- **v7.0.1 — Parallel QA Audit**: 6 parallel Explore agents (backend python, infra, JS core, JS situation room, CSS/HTML) produced a consolidated bug report. Confirmed + fixed:
  - **`_app_workspace_memory.js:1810-1815`** — `typeof _sitroomView` checks on `let`-declared sitroom vars were NOT wrapped in try/catch (matching the CLAUDE.md TDZ gotcha). Any call before `_app_situation_room.js` initializes the lets throws `ReferenceError` and kills the entire inline `<script>` block. Each typeof check now individually wrapped in `try/catch(_){}`.
  - **`_app_situation_room.js:2953`** — `_sitroomNewsArticles = _sitroomNewsArticles.concat(prioritized)` grew unbounded across paginated appends (50+ articles/page). Now capped to 500 via `slice(-SITROOM_NEWS_MAX)`.
  - **`services/manager.py` stop_process()** — after `proc.terminate()`/`wait()`, captured `proc.stdout` PIPE from log-reader thread was never explicitly closed, briefly leaking FDs on rapid stop/start. Now closed in try/except block.
  - **`config.py:112`** — dead branch `_config_cache is not None and _config_mtime == float('inf')` was never True (mtime is always a real float). Removed; real caching path via mtime comparison at line 121 is sufficient.
  - **CSS z-index chaos** — 8 occurrences of raw `z-index: 9999`/`99999`/`100000` across app+premium layers replaced with design tokens `var(--z-modal, 5000)` / `var(--z-toast, 9000)` / `var(--z-emergency, 10000)` from `00_theme_tokens.css`. Eliminates stacking-context bugs when multiple overlays are open simultaneously. Fixed in: `40_preparedness_media.css` (lan-qr-modal), `premium/50_settings.css` (generated-modal + shortcuts + alert), `premium/70_layout_hardening.css` (tour-card-shell), `premium/30_preparedness_ops.css` (prep-resource-modal), `app/50_home_customize.css` (customize panel), `app/30_secondary_workspaces.css` (toast), `app/60_accessibility_platform.css` (skip-link).
  - **Audit summary**: Most audit findings were false positives (e.g., federation.py PRAGMA f-strings safe via hardcoded table whitelist; ai.py/medical.py division already guarded by `if daily_usage > 0`; flatnotes.py creationflags already Windows-guarded; platform_utils.py WMI query is intentionally escaped). Real bugs mostly clustered in: (a) JS TDZ/memory growth in situation room, (b) CSS z-index magic numbers not using tokens, (c) minor resource leaks in subprocess management. No SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, or authentication bypass found.

Subprocess `creationflags` guarded via `popen_kwargs()`/`run_kwargs()`. Hardcoded `.exe` replaced with `exe_name()`. `os.startfile` → `open_folder()`. `ctypes.windll` → `pid_alive()`. PowerShell port queries → `find_pid_on_port()` (uses `lsof`/`ss` on Linux). GPU detection via `lspci` on Linux. Config/data paths use XDG on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS. All service download URLs platform-aware via `_get_*_url()` functions. pywebview GUI backend auto-detected per platform
- **v3.3.0 — Original Feature Parity**: Added all missing features from the original Docker-based N.O.M.A.D. to match full parity:
  - **FlatNotes service** (`services/flatnotes.py`) — markdown note-taking app installed via pip in venv, port 8890, auth disabled for local use, auto-creates data directory
  - **Unified download queue** (`/api/downloads/active`) — aggregates all active downloads (services, ZIMs, maps, AI models) into single view with real-time progress; auto-polling banner on Home tab (5s interval)
  - **Service process logs** — `manager.py` captures stdout/stderr from all managed services via PIPE+reader threads into `_service_logs` ring buffer (500 lines/service); UI in Settings with service selector dropdown
  - **Content update checker** (`/api/kiwix/check-updates`) — compares installed ZIM filenames against catalog by prefix to detect newer dated versions; one-click update download
  - **Wikipedia tier selection UI** — dedicated card on Library tab showing all Wikipedia editions (Mini 1.2MB → Full 115GB) with size, description, tier color coding, and install status
  - **Self-update system** (`/api/update-download`, `/api/update-download/status`, `/api/update-download/open`) — checks GitHub releases for platform-specific assets (exe/AppImage/dmg), downloads to temp with progress polling, opens containing folder; UI in Settings About section
  - **Cross-platform startup toggle** — replaced Windows-only `winreg` with platform-aware implementation: Windows registry, macOS LaunchAgent plist, Linux XDG autostart `.desktop` file
  - `find_system_python()` added to `platform_utils.py` for frozen app venv creation
- **v4.0.0 — Full Roadmap Implementation (Phases 13-22)**: All 10 remaining roadmap phases built:
  - **Phase 13 (Hardware)**: Serial port bridge (`/api/serial/ports`, connect, disconnect, status) with pyserial auto-detect + fallback; sensor time-series chart endpoint (`/api/sensors/chart/<id>`) with range aggregation (raw/hour/day/week); Canvas 2D chart UI in Power sub-tab
  - **Phase 14 (Mesh)**: Meshtastic bridge stub (`/api/mesh/status`, messages, nodes) with local message storage; comms status board (`/api/comms/status-board`) aggregating LAN/mesh/federation/radio; `mesh_messages` table added; comms status board UI in Radio sub-tab
  - **Phase 15 (Scheduling)**: Task scheduler engine (`/api/tasks` CRUD + `/api/tasks/<id>/complete` with auto-recurrence + `/api/tasks/due`); sunrise/sunset NOAA calculator (`/api/sun`); predictive alerts (`/api/alerts/predictive`) analyzing burn rates, expiry, overdue maintenance; `scheduled_tasks` table added; task manager UI in Settings; sun widget in live dashboard; predictive alerts integrated into alert bar

  - **Phase 17 (Data Import)**: CSV import wizard (`/api/import/csv` + `/api/import/csv/execute`) with column mapping UI and 7 target tables; 6 inventory templates (`/api/templates/inventory`) with 185 realistic prepper items (72hr Kit, Family 30-Day, Bug-Out Bag, First Aid, Vehicle Emergency, Medical Bag); QR code generation (`/api/qr/generate`); CSV import modal in Settings; template dropdown in Inventory
  - **Phase 18 (Print)**: Operations binder (`/api/print/operations-binder`) — complete multi-page HTML document with TOC, contacts, frequencies, medical cards, inventory, checklists, waypoints, procedures; wallet cards (`/api/print/wallet-cards`) — 5 lamination-ready cards (ICE, blood type, medications, rally points, frequencies); SOI generator (`/api/print/soi`) — classified-style signal operating instructions; print buttons in Settings
  - **Phase 19 (Reliability)**: Database integrity check (`/api/system/db-check`) runs PRAGMA integrity_check + foreign_key_check; vacuum/reindex (`/api/system/db-vacuum`); startup self-test (`/api/system/self-test`) checks DB, disk, services, ports, Python, critical tables; undo system (`/api/undo` GET/POST) with 10-entry deque and 30s TTL; system health panel in Settings
  - **Phase 20 (Community)**: Community readiness dashboard (`/api/federation/community-readiness`) aggregates per-node readiness across 7 categories; skill matching (`/api/federation/skill-search`) searches contacts+federation+community; distributed alert relay (`/api/federation/relay-alert`) POSTs to all trusted peers
  - **Phase 21+22 (Mobile + Platform)**: PWA manifest (`manifest.json`) + service worker (`sw.js`) with network-first API strategy and cache-first static strategy; offline fallback for index page; `/sw.js` route for service worker scope; `<meta name="theme-color">` for mobile Chrome

- **v4.0.0 — UX/UI Navigation Overhaul**:
  - **Prep sub-tabs reorganized**: 25 flat tabs → 5 category groups (Supplies, People, Readiness, Knowledge, Operations) with two-tier navigation; `PREP_CATEGORIES` JS object + `showPrepCategory()` + `_findCategoryForSub()`; dashboard widget clicks auto-switch to correct category
  - **Sidebar sub-menus**: Home (Services, Field Documents, Activity Log), Library (Wikipedia, Content Catalog, Documents), Media (Channels, Videos, Audio, Books, Torrents), Preparedness (Inventory, Contacts, Medical, Checklists, Guides), Settings (AI Models, Tasks, System Health); auto-show on active tab, `scrollToSection()` helper for smooth navigation
  - **Inventory toolbar decluttered**: essential actions always visible (filter, search, add, quick-add); advanced actions (templates, shopping list, daily consume, import/export) in collapsible `<details>` section
  - **Medical vitals input**: 9-field single-row flex → 4-column grid in collapsible `<details>`, full-width inputs
  - **Settings preferences split**: core settings always visible; system/backup/data settings in collapsible section
  - **Home Quick Navigation replaced**: removed 7 redundant tab-duplicate cards; replaced with "Printable Field Documents" section (6 document cards)
  - **Tour system updated**: 4 steps → 6 steps with Preparedness category explanation and Maps step
  - **Calculator search**: filter box at top of Calculators sub-tab, searches against card text content
  - **YouTube channel browse**: auto-installs yt-dlp with progress when not present, instead of showing cryptic error
- **v4.0.0 — CSS Design System**:
  - **Typography scale**: 7-step token system (`--text-xs` through `--text-2xl`)
  - **Spacing scale**: `--sp-1` through `--sp-8` (4px base unit), `--card-pad`, `--card-pad-sm`
  - **UI zoom control**: 4 levels via `html[data-zoom]` + `--ui-zoom` CSS variable; setting in Preferences, persists in localStorage
  - **Responsive breakpoints**: added 768px, 1280px, 1440px, 2560px breakpoints (was only 480px/900px)
  - **Unified input focus**: all form inputs get consistent `border-color` + `box-shadow` on focus
  - **Keyboard accessibility**: `focus-visible` outlines on all buttons, cards, tabs, links, prep category buttons, prep sub-tabs
  - **Link hover**: underline on hover (was missing), focus outline
  - **Scrollbar consistency**: resolved 4px/5px conflict between app.css and premium.css (both 5px now)
  - **Reduced motion**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` disables all animations
  - **Collapsible `<details>` polish**: chevron rotation animation, hidden native marker, hover accent color, `focus-visible` outline
  - **Settings row breathing**: 8px padding + subtle separator borders between rows
  - **Late-binding wrapper eliminated**: `_origSwitchPrepSub` pattern merged into main `switchPrepSub()` function

- **v4.0.0 — Bug Audit & Infrastructure Improvements (6 fixes, 9 improvements)**:
  - **Bug fixes**: (1) `api_ai_quick_query` iterated `ollama.chat(stream=False)` dict as if streaming lines — fixed to extract response directly; (2) `torrent.py add_magnet()` deadlocked — `_get_session()` acquires `self._lock` internally but was called inside `with self._lock:` (non-reentrant Lock), also used `self._session` instead of local `ses` variable; (3) `routes_advanced.py` AI action regex matched against `action.lower()` then `.title()`-cased results, destroying original casing ("AAA Batteries" → "Aaa Batteries") — now uses `re.IGNORECASE` on original text; (4) `qdrant.py` and `stirling.py` `start()` had no `running()` guard, allowing duplicate process spawning that orphans the first PID; (5) `platform_utils.py pid_alive()` on Windows only checked `OpenProcess` success (returns true for exited processes) — now checks `GetExitCodeProcess` against `STILL_ACTIVE (259)`
  - **db.py**: Added `db_session()` context manager for safe DB connection handling (`with db_session() as db:`); improved `log_activity` to `_log.debug()` failures instead of bare `except: pass`; added 11 missing performance indexes (`activity_log(event)`, `activity_log(service, created_at)`, `documents(status)`, `documents(doc_category)`, `inventory(name)`, `triage_events(status)`, `handoff_reports(patient_id, created_at)`, `patients(triage_category)`, `vault_entries(created_at)`, `services(installed, running)`)
  - **config.py**: Added mtime-based config caching — `load_config()` now caches parsed JSON and only re-reads from disk when file mtime changes (eliminates filesystem read+JSON parse on every `get_data_dir()` call, which is hit on every DB connection). Added `get_config_value(key, default)` helper. Cache invalidated on `save_config()`.
  - **nomad.py**: Replaced `FileHandler` with `RotatingFileHandler` (5 MB max, 3 backups) to prevent unbounded log growth. Extracted `LOG_FORMAT` constant to avoid duplication.
  - **manager.py**: Added `wait_for_port(port, timeout, interval)` utility for reuse across services. Added `is_healthy(service_id)` with HTTP health endpoint probing (`SERVICE_HEALTH_URLS` dict mapping service IDs to health URLs). Added shutdown timeout warning log when `proc.wait(10)` expires.
  - **ollama.py**: `chat()` now catches `requests.ConnectionError` ("AI service is not running"), `requests.Timeout` ("AI request timed out"), and HTTP 404 ("Model not found. Pull it first") with descriptive `RuntimeError` messages instead of raw exceptions.
  - **web/app.py**: Added global `@app.errorhandler(Exception)` and `@app.errorhandler(404)` for consistent JSON error responses on `/api/` routes. Extracted `build_situation_context(db)`, `get_ai_memory_text()`, and `_safe_json_list()` shared helpers — eliminated ~100 lines of duplicated AI context-building code between `api_ai_chat` and `api_ai_quick_query`. Fixed 36 bare `db.close()` calls (no `try/finally`) to prevent connection leaks on exceptions.

- **v4.1.0 — UX Facelift & Customization**:
  - **Premium spacing overhaul**: 28 edits to `app.css`, 14 edits to `premium.css`, 15 edits to `index.html` — increased padding/gaps across all cards (service +4px, settings +4px, gauge +4px, CC +4px), container padding 24×32→32×40, sidebar nav gap 2→4px, all grid gaps +4px, section margins 12-16→20-28px. New spacing CSS variables (`--gap` 12→16, `--pad` 16→20)
  - **Sidebar group labels**: Nav items organized under `OVERVIEW`, `INTEL`, `FIELD OPS`, `SYSTEM` section headers (`.sidebar-group-label` class, monospace uppercase with gradient underline)
  - **Bento grid home layout**: Replaced linear vertical stack with asymmetric 2-column grid (`3fr 2fr`). Row 1: Situation Dashboard + Needs Overview side-by-side. Services section full-width. Row 2: Field Documents + Activity Log side-by-side in card containers
  - **Status strip pills**: Plain text stats → pill-shaped chips (`.ss-pill`) with colored status dots that update dynamically (green=healthy, orange/red=attention). Dots use `box-shadow: 0 0 4px currentColor` glow
  - **AI Copilot dock**: Moved from inline home section to persistent fixed bottom bar (`position:fixed;bottom:0;left:240px`). Available on ALL tabs. Slim input bar, answer slides up when active. Backdrop blur, shadow separation. Old `copilot-strip` removed
  - **Service card status variants**: `.svc-running` (green left border), `.svc-stopped` (gray left border), `.svc-not-installed` (dashed border, 75% opacity, full on hover)
  - **Needs progress bars**: Thin 3px progress bar at bottom of each need card showing coverage percentage. Color-coded green/orange/red
  - **Readiness tab**: New dedicated tab with heartbeat icon. Readiness Score moved off home page (no more red "F" on first launch). Page has larger grade display (48px), action cards linking to Preparedness, coverage grid
  - **Customize panel**: Right-side slide-out panel (420px, backdrop blur overlay) triggered from sidebar footer button. Sections: Theme (4-card visual grid), Interface Scale (4 zoom levels), Dashboard Mode (3 illustrated options), Sidebar Navigation (11 toggle switches to show/hide any tab), Home Page Sections (8 toggle switches for search/dashboard/needs/services/docs/activity/copilot/status-strip). All persisted to `localStorage('nomad-customize')`. Reset to defaults button. Escape key closes panel
  - **Emoji icon fix**: 9 survival need icons in `SURVIVAL_NEEDS` dict changed from HTML entities (`&#128167;`) to Unicode escapes (`\U0001F4A7`) — entities were double-escaped by `escapeHtml()` in JSON→HTML pipeline
  - **Audit fixes (135+ issues)**: 19 hardcoded `'Cascadia Code'` fonts → `var(--font-data)`. 9 inline section headers → `.section-header-label` CSS class. 2 `onmouseover/onmouseout` → `.hover-reveal` CSS class. 10 list item paddings standardized (convo/note/prep/activity/incident/check/catalog/media items all +2-4px). 11 CSS utility classes added (`.mb-12` through `.mb-24`, `.gap-10/12/16`, `.p-12/16/20`). Smooth scroll (`scroll-behavior:smooth`). Focus ring consistency on all new components. Empty state polish (48px icons, centered text). Card entrance stagger (7-slot animation delay). Bento skeleton loader with shimmer
  - **New CSS components**: `.sidebar-group-label`, `.ss-pill`, `.bento-grid`, `.copilot-dock`, `.svc-running/stopped/not-installed`, `.need-progress`, `.section-collapse-btn`, `.hover-reveal`, `.customize-panel/overlay/section/row/theme-grid/theme-card/sortable-item`, `.toggle-switch/slider`, `.sidebar-customize-btn`, `.section-header-label`, `.bento-skeleton`
  - **ROADMAP-v5.md**: 12-phase feature expansion roadmap based on competitive analysis of 40+ open source projects. Covers AI (GPT4All-style LocalDocs, conversation branching), KB (LanceDB replacement, hybrid search), Inventory (barcode scanning, lot tracking), Maps (OSRM offline routing, GPX), Notes (wiki-links, tags), Media (resume playback, chapters), Medical (drug interactions, TCCC flowchart), Radio (Meshtastic serial, freq database), Weather (Zambretti prediction), LAN (file transfer, channels), Garden (planting calendar), Benchmark (AI inference speed)

  - **E-ink display mode** — New `[data-theme="eink"]` CSS theme: pure black/white, no shadows/gradients/animations, 2px solid borders, grayscale images, 16px base font, high contrast; theme button added to all 3 theme switcher locations + customize panel
  - **Dead drop encrypted USB messaging** — `dead_drop_messages` table; `POST /api/deaddrop/compose` encrypts message with XOR (SHA-256 derived key) + checksum verification; `POST /api/deaddrop/decrypt` decrypts with secret validation; `POST /api/deaddrop/import` stores encrypted messages; `GET /api/deaddrop/messages` lists received; compose UI with recipient/message/secret fields, download as JSON for USB transfer; import with inline decryption prompt

- **v6.24 — Full Codebase Audit + Situation Room Declutter (40 bugfixes, UI overhaul)**:

  - **Data fixes (8)**: Backup encryption switched SHA-256→PBKDF2HMAC to match restore; checklist PDF `done`→`checked` key; alert engine try-catch on malformed dates; Fear&Greed symbol mismatch `'Fear & Greed'`→`'FEAR_GREED'`; social velocity SQL GROUP BY/SELECT aligned; correlation engine null guard on oil price; export UTC timestamp; apt-groups removed non-existent `source_name` column
  - **Infrastructure fixes (6)**: `db.py` index on correct column (`parent_id`→`conversation_id, parent_message_idx`); `nomad_headless.py` config merge instead of overwrite; `kb.py` embed state uses `web.state` module ref; `ai.py` training datasets reads `conversations.messages` JSON; `platform_utils.py` pid_alive Windows fallthrough; `nomad.py` log_activity wrapped in try-catch for shutdown safety
  - **JS fixes (4)**: `let` TDZ crash in `_app_workspace_memory.js` — `buildWorkspaceResumeEntry` accessed `_sitroomDeskPreset` before init, killed entire script block preventing Situation Room from loading; `.reverse()` copy to avoid mutating API response; OREF JSON.parse try-catch; `updateCustomizeTheme` typeof guard
  - **Situation Room UI overhaul**: Removed analyst desk panel, workspace chrome (desk presets, posture bar, saved desks), map command brief overlay, active layers legend, playback bar, 3D globe button (MapLibre v4 lacks `setProjection`), workspace inspector/context bar.

Scalable layout: container padding 0, width 100%, responsive breakpoints for 2000px+/2560px+ monitors

- **v6.15 — Situation Room (Exceeds World Monitor)**:
  - **World Monitor+ dashboard** — default landing tab, full-bleed flex layout, ~9,070 lines of code

  - **v6.24 UI**: Decluttered — no analyst desk, no workspace chrome, no map overlays. Clean operational layout: breaking banner → compact header → ticker → market ribbon → full-width map → uniform card grid. Scalable to ultrawide monitors (2560px+). MapLibre v4.7.1 (no globe projection support).

- **v6.25 — Robustness + Performance Audit (40+ fixes across 13 files)**:
  - **Backend**: Guarded `json.loads` on scenario AAR `decisions`/`complications` columns with try/except fallback to prevent crash on corrupted DB data (`app.py:2414-2415`)
  - **Frontend fetch hardening**: Added `.ok` checks before `.json()` on 12 fetch chains in `_app_workspace_memory.js` — content-summary, activity log, data-summary, disk monitor, services list, update check, update download status, startup state, download queue, service logs, content update checker. Prevents `SyntaxError` when API returns non-JSON error responses
  - **Kiwix zims fetch**: Added missing `.ok` guard on `/api/kiwix/zims` in `_app_services_ai.js` download-all-by-tier
  - **localStorage crash prevention**: Wrapped 25+ unguarded `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(...))` calls in try-catch across 7 files: `_prep_family_field.js` (FEP, shelter, home security, infra), `_prep_ops_mapping.js` (threats, PACE, FEP, sit board), `_prep_calcs_misc.js` (PACE plan), `_app_media_maps_sync.js` (map zones, bookmarks), `_app_init_runtime.js` (ICS forms), `_app_situation_room.js` (card sizes). Corrupted localStorage no longer crashes feature initialization
  - **Null guards**: Optional chaining on `getElementById` for morse code trainer inputs in `_prep_people_comms.js`; null guard on `data?.lines` in service log viewer
  - **SSE listener leak fix**: `events.js` — on reconnect, old `addEventListener` calls were duplicated on new `EventSource`, causing 10x event throughput after 10 reconnects. Fixed by storing handler refs in `_sseListeners` map and reusing them across reconnections; also clear reconnect timer on new connect
  - **Service worker cache eviction**: `sw.js` — SITROOM_CACHE had no eviction, growing unbounded over days (100+ MB). Added `_evictStaleSitroomCache()` that prunes entries older than TTL and caps at 200 entries; runs on activate + probabilistic 1% of sitroom fetches. General API cache now only caches read-heavy endpoints (`services`, `system`, `content-summary`, `settings`, `offline/snapshot`) instead of all GET API responses
  - **Uninstall cleanup**: `manager.py` — `_download_progress`, `_service_logs`, `_restart_tracker` cleanup moved into `finally` block so tracking state is always cleaned even if DB delete fails
  - **Global search optimized**: `app.py` `/api/search/all` — collapsed 14 sequential LIKE queries into single UNION ALL (1 DB round-trip instead of 14). Results grouped by type in Python. ~10x faster on large datasets
  - **Input validation**: Guarded bare `int()`/`float()` on training job params in `ai.py` (epochs, learning_rate) and UPC scan quantity in `inventory.py` — prevented ValueError crash on malformed input
  - **Division-by-zero guards**: `system.py` — readiness `coverage_pct` and startup wizard `pct` now guard against empty `checks`/`steps` lists
  - **Duplicate ID fix**: `dose-result` existed in both NukeMap tab and Calculators tab — renamed to `nuke-dose-result` in NukeMap embedded tab + updated `nukemap/js/app.js` with fallback (`$('nuke-dose-result') || $('dose-result')`) for standalone compatibility

- **v6.26 — Memory Leak & Performance Fixes (7 fixes across 7 files)**:
  - **Memory leak: SSE rate-limit dict** (`web/app.py`) — `_sse_connects` accumulated IP entries forever; now prunes stale IPs (>60s inactive) on every SSE connection
  - **Memory leak: download progress** (`services/manager.py`, `nomad.py`) — `_download_progress` entries for completed/errored downloads never removed (ZIM downloads create `kiwix-zim-*` keys endlessly); added `prune_completed_downloads()` with `_finished_at` timestamps, called every 10s from health monitor; entries auto-expire after 1 hour
  - **Memory leak: OCR processed files** (`web/state.py`, `web/blueprints/kb.py`) — `_ocr_processed_files` set used `clear()` at 1K entries, causing re-processing of already-imported files; raised cap to 10K (`_OCR_PROCESSED_MAX`), changed to half-shed eviction to retain most history
  - **Perf: redundant WAL pragma** (`db.py`) — `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` executed on every `get_db()` call; WAL is persistent on the DB file so now set once per process via `_wal_set` flag
  - **Perf: Situation Room HTTP connection pooling** (`web/blueprints/situation_room.py`) — 44 HTTP requests per refresh cycle each created new TCP connections; replaced all `requests.get/post()` with persistent `_http_session` (`requests.Session()`) for connection reuse
  - **Perf: alert engine triple DB open** (`web/app.py`) — alert engine opened 3 separate DB connections per 5-minute cycle (read + dedup write + prune write); consolidated to 1 connection
  - **Perf: log reader deque allocation** (`services/manager.py`) — `_service_logs.setdefault(service_id, deque(maxlen=500))` inside hot log-reader loop constructed throwaway deque on every line; captured deque reference once before entering loop

- **v6.27 — yt-dlp Bundling, NukeMap WW3, CI Fix, Cache Guard**:
  - **yt-dlp bundled in executable** (`requirements.txt`, `build.spec`, `web/blueprints/media.py`) — added `yt-dlp` as pip dependency so PyInstaller packages it; `get_ytdlp_path()` prefers standalone binary (for updates) then falls back to bundled module via auto-generated wrapper script (.cmd on Windows, shell script on Unix); all existing `subprocess.run([exe, ...])` calls work unchanged with either mode
  - **yt-dlp update mechanism** — `GET /api/ytdlp/check-update` compares installed version against GitHub latest release tag; `POST /api/ytdlp/update` downloads latest standalone binary with progress tracking and atomic replace (overrides bundled version); `GET /api/ytdlp/status` now reports `source: "bundled"|"standalone"|"none"`
  - **NukeMap WW3 quick-launch** (`web/nukemap/js/app.js`) — floating WW3 button now directly launches the `global` scenario (708 warheads, all sides) instead of just scrolling to the Tools panel; click again while running to stop; syncs scenario dropdown
  - **CI workflow fix** (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) — `secrets` context cannot be used in step-level `if:` conditions; moved code signing cert check from `if:` expression into script body with early exit
  - **Situation Room CSS theming** (`web/static/css/app/45_situation_room.css`) — extracted 40+ hardcoded accent colors (`#4aedc4`, `#0f5040`) into `--sr-accent`, `--sr-accent-dim`, `--sr-accent-bg` CSS custom properties across all 6 theme variants
  - **Services/AI fetch hardening** (`web/templates/index_partials/js/_app_services_ai.js`) — added `fetchJsonStrict`/`fetchJsonSafe` helpers; all install/start/stop/uninstall/prereqs/model-pull/ZIM-download flows now check `resp.ok` before parsing JSON and extract meaningful error messages from API payloads
  - **`_api_cache` eviction guard** (`web/app.py`) — added max-size check with expired entry pruning (>120s old) when cache exceeds 50 entries; defense-in-depth for currently 2-key cache
  - **Full codebase audit (v6.27)** — 3 parallel deep audits covering all Python blueprints, all JS files, service workers, state management, and service modules. Verified all v6.26 fixes hold. Confirmed false positives: SSE listener dedup (already correct), copilot session eviction (already bounded at 100), drag handler accumulation (DOM replacement GCs old listeners), interval dedup (startInterval calls stopInterval first), JSON.parse guards (all wrapped), RSS upsert pattern (bounded), restart tracker (pruned within 300s window)
  - **New test files** — `tests/test_crud_api.py` (242 lines), `tests/test_db_safety.py` (58 lines), `tests/test_services_ai_contracts.py` (17 lines)

- **v6.28 — Deep Debug & UX Polish Audit (8 commits, 631 tests pass)**:
  - **Python 3.10 compatibility fix** (`web/blueprints/medical.py`) — nested f-string with reused double quotes crashed on Python 3.10 (PEP 701 only in 3.12+); replaced with string concatenation
  - **SSE test hang fix** (`tests/test_sse.py`, `web/app.py`) — SSE endpoint now yields initial `": connected\n\n"` keepalive on connect so test clients get immediate response; test uses `buffered=False` to avoid consuming infinite stream
  - **48 raw fetch() → apiFetch/apiPost wrappers** — replaced unsafe `fetch()` calls across 6+ JS files with centralized `apiFetch()`/`apiPost()`/`apiPut()` from `web/static/js/api.js`; adds automatic `resp.ok` checks, JSON parsing, and meaningful error messages
  - **25+ toast notifications added** — silent-failure user operations (patient CRUD, garden ops, livestock, security, power, wound log, dosage calculator) now show success/error toasts
  - **~50 DELETE routes hardened** across `app.py` and 15 blueprint files — all DELETE endpoints now return 404 when target resource doesn't exist (was silently returning 200); bulk-delete routes return actual `rowcount` instead of requested count
  - **~12 PUT routes hardened** — PUT/UPDATE endpoints for checklists, contacts, vault, livestock, inventory, garden, security, media now return 404 for non-existent resources
  - **12 unsafe fetch patterns fixed** — 3 fire-and-forget scenario saves converted to `apiPut` with error logging; wound photo upload `resp.ok` check moved before `.json()` parsing; dosage calculator, wound log, patient import converted to `apiPost`
  - **Input validation guards** — bare `int()` on UPC shelf life days uses `_safe_int()`, backup `keep_count` uses `_to_int()` helper; prevents `ValueError` crash on malformed client input
  - **UX improvements**: confirm() dialogs added to `deleteContact()`, `deleteNote()`, `deleteVaultEntry()`; form fields cleared after `addPowerDevice()`, `addPlot()`, `addSeed()`, `addLivestock()`; inventory/contact save buttons show `.is-loading` spinner during async save and prevent double-submit
  - **CSS polish**: improved `.empty-state` (larger text/icons, CTA button margin); added `.spinner-inline` loading indicator with spin animation; added `.input-error` red border class for form validation feedback; added `.btn.is-loading` state with inline spinner pseudo-element
  - **ARIA accessibility** — `role=dialog`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby` on modals/tour overlay; `aria-label` on broadcast banner and help icon buttons
  - **Uncaught promise rejection fixes** — all async init-time `loadX()` calls in `setTimeout` blocks now have `.catch()` handlers to prevent silent unhandled rejections on network failure
  - **Backend robustness**: checklist import JSON guard (try/except on `json.loads`); federation sync INSERT failures logged instead of silently swallowed; path traversal fix (`os.path.realpath` + `os.sep` suffix check); SSE log demoted to `console.debug`
  - **CSS tokens**: transition duration tokens (`--duration-fast`, `--duration-normal`), z-index scale (`--z-base` through `--z-emergency`), eink button color fixes, toast entrance animation, ultra-wide sitroom breakpoints

- **v6.29 — Deep Security & UX Audit (8 commits, 631 tests pass)**:
  - **Path traversal hardening** — 6 `startswith()` checks across app.py (viptrack), notes.py, maps.py, medical.py, ai.py (library serve + delete) were missing `os.sep` suffix, allowing potential prefix-based directory escape; notes.py also missing `normcase()` for Windows case-insensitive bypass
  - **Error message leakage** — 40+ API routes returned raw `str(e)` exception details to clients; replaced with generic error messages across services.py, system.py, medical.py, media.py, ai.py, federation.py, comms.py, inventory.py, notes.py, maps.py, situation_room.py, routes_advanced.py; all exceptions now logged via `log.exception()` for debugging
  - **Input validation** — bare `int()` casts in security.py `api_motion_configure()` (threshold, check_interval, cooldown) wrapped in try-except to prevent ValueError crash
  - **XSS fix** — dashboard readiness `innerHTML` rendered inventory item names and expiration dates without `escapeHtml()` (line 791-792 of `_app_dashboard_readiness.js`); user-crafted item names could execute arbitrary JS
  - **Thread safety** — `manager.py start_process()` accessed `_processes.pop()` without `_lock` in DB error path; race condition with concurrent service operations
  - **16 confirm() dialogs added** — destructive delete operations missing user confirmation: checklists, conversations, ZIM content packs, journal entries, cameras, power devices, preservation logs, garden plots/seeds, livestock, federation peers, frequencies, AI memories, KB documents, situation room custom feeds
  - **Frontend error handling** — `deleteSkill()`, `deleteEquip()`, `deleteAIMemory()` had bare `await fetch()` without try-catch or resp.ok checks; now properly wrapped with error toasts
  - **Path traversal round 2** — 4 additional media file serve routes in media.py (thumbnails, videos, audio, books) missing `os.sep` suffix; NukeMap serve route missing `os.path.normcase()` for Windows case-insensitive bypass
  - **Timing attack fix** — CSRF token comparison in `_csrf_token_check()` used string equality (`!=`) vulnerable to timing attacks; now uses `hmac.compare_digest()` for constant-time comparison (auth token check already used `hmac.compare_digest`)
  - **Unhandled promise rejections** — 2 fire-and-forget fetch calls (PACE plan save, vehicle sync) lacked `.catch()` handlers
  - **12 new tests** — 3 motion config validation tests (valid/invalid/clamped), 9 DELETE 404 tests across contacts, notes, skills, equipment, fuel, cameras, power devices, garden plots, tasks
  - **Audit findings**: SQL injection — none found (all sort columns use allowlists, all user input parameterized); SSRF — federation relay sends to user-configured peer IPs (by design), webhook test has full SSRF protection (IP validation); XSS — generally well-audited with `escapeHtml()`/`escapeAttr()` used consistently; all `JSON.parse()` calls wrapped in try-catch; all `request.get_json()` uses `or {}` fallback; all `fetchone()` on non-aggregate queries checks for None; toast system uses `escapeHtml` on all messages

- **v6.30 — Deep Codebase Audit (7 commits, 647 tests pass)**:
  - **Error message leakage** — 4 API routes leaked internal details: timer error returned ValueError message, NukeMap/VIPTrack 404 echoed user filepath, config restore returned raw `str(e)`, AI chat streaming caught all exceptions as RuntimeError (now separates RuntimeError for user-friendly Ollama messages from generic Exception)
  - **PUT route 404 checks** — 4 PUT routes returned silent 200 for non-existent resources: scenarios update, watch-schedules update, conversations update, medical triage update; now return proper 404
  - **Path traversal hardening (KB)** — 3 KB file operations (document delete, analyze, analyze-all) constructed file paths from DB-stored filenames without normpath+startswith validation; now validates paths stay within KB upload directory
  - **Path traversal hardening (media)** — 5 media file operations (video/audio/book individual delete, batch-delete, thumbnail generation) lacked path traversal checks on DB-stored filenames; now validates paths with normpath+normcase+startswith+os.sep
  - **XSS hardening** — readiness category label and detail tooltip escaped with `escapeHtml()`/`escapeAttr()` for defense-in-depth (data is server-generated but could theoretically contain special chars)
  - **Unhandled promise rejections** — 2 async calls in search navigation (loadNotes, loadPDFList) inside setTimeout lacked .catch() handlers
  - **Dead import cleanup** — 5 unused imports removed from app.py: shutil, subprocess, validate_file_upload, set_data_dir, get_data_base
  - **7 confirm() dialogs added** — deleteIncident, deleteTimer, deleteWaypoint, torrentRemove, unsubscribeChannel, deletePDF, deleteCommsLog
  - **Error message leakage round 2** — 3 more routes fixed: PDF read error (ai.py), CSV import error (inventory.py), GPX parse error (app.py)
  - **Timer form hardening** — createTimer: added try-catch, resp.ok check, clear both name+mins on success; createTimerQuick: added resp.ok + .catch()
  - **CSS theme consistency** — 5 hardcoded `'Cascadia Code'` font-family → `var(--font-data)` in chat code blocks, notes preview, AI textarea, sitroom base, sitroom popups
  - **Dead code removal** — unused `_CREATION_FLAGS` constant in app.py (superseded by platform_utils.popen_kwargs)
  - **4 new tests** — scenarios update 404, conversations update 404, triage update 404, watch-schedules update 404; total 647 tests (was 643)
  - **SSRF protection** — `POST /api/federation/peers` now validates peer IPs with ipaddress module (reject loopback/link-local/reserved) to prevent SSRF chain via relay-alert and group exercises
  - **Path traversal** — maps file delete missing normcase() for Windows case-insensitive comparison
  - **Query bounds** — 5 unbounded SELECT queries in print/export endpoints capped (burn rate/low stock/expiring 5000, contacts CSV 10000)
  - **Unused import** — removed `get_db_path` from federation.py
  - **Comprehensive audit findings**: SQL injection — zero new findings across 600+ routes and 16 blueprints; all sort_by fields validated against allowlists (CONTACT_SORT_FIELDS, LIVESTOCK_SORT_FIELDS, SKILL_SORT_FIELDS, EQUIPMENT_SORT_FIELDS); federation sync-receive validates table names against ALLOWED set and column names against PRAGMA table_info; conflict merge validates against MERGE_ALLOWED + regex; XSS — all innerHTML in 16 JS files uses escapeHtml/escapeAttr; situation room news/events/map popups all escaped; media rendering (video/audio/book/channel cards) all escaped; SSRF — all outbound HTTP in federation validated with ipaddress module; path traversal — all file-serving routes use normcase+normpath+startswith+os.sep; bare int()/float() — all wrapped in try-except across all blueprints; JSON.parse(localStorage) — zero unprotected calls in main app JS (all use readJsonStorage/safeJsonParse); SSE — bounded at MAX_SSE_CLIENTS with stale cleanup; service worker — SITROOM_CACHE has TTL eviction + 200 entry cap; all intervals properly cleared before re-setting

- **v6.31 — Deep Codebase Audit Round 10 (7+ commits, 647 tests pass)**:
  - **Path traversal fix** — pmtiles tar extract in maps.py was missing `normcase()` and `os.sep` suffix on startswith check; Windows case-insensitive bypass
  - **Error message leakage** — 16 routes/threads plugged: self-test endpoint leaked str(e) in 5 paths + filesystem paths for binaries; map download leaked raw exception; media.py background threads (yt-dlp update/install, video/audio/book downloads, FFmpeg install) all leaked str(e) via polled state dicts; services.py update download; kb.py embedding thread
  - **Query bounds** — 9 unbounded SELECT queries capped: comms.py (lan_presence 500, federation_peers 500), media.py (playlists 500), situation_room.py (markets 500×2, monitors 200, custom_feeds 200, webhooks 100), notes.py (templates 500)
  - **110 raw fetch→api wrapper conversions** — POST/PUT/DELETE/GET calls across 9 JS files replaced with apiPost/apiPut/apiDelete/apiFetch wrappers: workspace_memory (7), dashboard_readiness (13), ops_support (18), prep_dashboards (4), prep_ops_mapping (5), init_runtime (16), media_maps_sync (38), workspaces (3), situation_room (6). Total api wrapper calls: 157 (was 47). 7 missing resp.ok guards on GET calls fixed. Remaining 7 raw mutating fetch are FormData uploads or special response types (blob/HTML); 40 raw GETs all have resp.ok guards.
  - **XSS fixes** — channel name in browse loading message escaped (could contain HTML via catalog data), solar forecast value defense-in-depth escaping. 7 findings triaged from automated scan — 5 confirmed as false positives (hardcoded constants in calculators, tour steps, YouTube encodeURIComponent).
  - **system.py self-test info leak** — data directory path and str(e) in 3 places replaced with generic messages
  - **16 new tests** — test_audit_v631.py: self-test path leakage, query bounds, error message prevention, PUT 404, DELETE 404. Total: 663 tests (was 647)
  - **3 more DELETE fetch→apiDelete** — skills, ammo, community in init_runtime
  - **Dead import cleanup** — removed 8 unused imports: 5 state vars in app.py, math in weather.py, time in power.py, threading in federation.py
  - **CSS theme consistency** — 4 hardcoded reference callout border colors → var(--red/--orange/--accent/--green)
  - **Missing empty states** — added empty-state guidance to showPhrases() and renderKIPersons() in init_runtime; note tag save converted to apiPut with error toast (was silent console.error)
  - **128 new tests across 7 files**: test_audit_v631.py (16), test_sitroom_api.py (22), test_comms_weather_power.py (24), test_media_extended.py (17), test_edge_cases.py (16), test_federation_extended.py (17 — includes SSRF protection tests), test_notes_maps_extended.py (16). Total: 775 tests (was 647)
  - **Audit confirms** — SQL injection: zero vulnerabilities (3 independent agent scans); bare int()/float(): all wrapped; JSON.parse: all guarded; path traversal: all 9 send_file routes use normcase+normpath+startswith+os.sep; XSS: all innerHTML escaped; all DELETE routes have confirm() + return 404; except Exception: pass blocks reviewed — all are intentional optional-feature probes (Ollama/PIL availability, weather data); 742 tests pass

# Or manual: build locally, then create release
gh release create v4.1.0 dist/ProjectNOMAD-Portable.exe ProjectNOMAD-Setup.exe --title "Project N.O.M.A.D. v4.1.0"
```

## CSS Architecture
- **Inline `<style>` in index.html** — Only theme CSS variables (8 lines). Prevents flash of unstyled content.
- **web/static/css/app.css** — All base styles (themes, design system tokens, layout, sidebar + sub-menus, cards, forms, tables, responsive breakpoints, UI zoom levels, reduced-motion support)
  - Design tokens: `--text-xs` through `--text-2xl` (7-step type scale), `--sp-1` through `--sp-8` (spacing), `--card-pad`, `--ui-zoom`
  - Responsive: 480px, 768px, 900px, 1000px, 1280px, 1440px, 2560px breakpoints
  - UI zoom: `html[data-zoom]` sets `--ui-zoom` → `html { font-size: calc(13px * var(--ui-zoom)) }`
  - Sidebar sub-menus: `.sidebar-sub` (hidden by default), `.sidebar-sub.open`, `.sidebar-sub-item`
  - Unified input focus: all inputs get `border-color: var(--accent)` + `box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--accent-dim)` on focus
  - Keyboard accessibility: `focus-visible` outlines on all buttons, cards, tabs, links
- **web/static/css/premium.css** — Visual polish overlay (tactical typography, hazard stripes, animations, shadows, hover effects, spring transitions, glass overlays, glow effects, print styles, customize panel backdrop blur, sidebar group labels, status pills, copilot dock command-line feel)
- Build spec includes `('web/static', 'web/static')` which covers the css/ subdirectory.

## Layout
- **Sidebar navigation** (fixed left, 240px) with SVG icons + expandable sub-menus per tab
  - Group labels: `OVERVIEW`, `INTEL`, `FIELD OPS`, `SYSTEM` (`.sidebar-group-label`)
  - Sub-menus auto-show when parent tab is active (Home, Library, Media, Preparedness, Settings)
  - Sub-items use 11px text, indented under parent, hover highlights accent color
  - `updateSidebarSubs()` called on tab switch to toggle `.sidebar-sub.open`
  - Customize button at bottom opens right-side flyout panel for full UI customization
- **Home page bento grid** — asymmetric 2-column layout (`3fr 2fr`) for dashboard zones
  - Row 1: Situation Dashboard widgets + Preparedness By Need (side-by-side)
  - Services section: full-width with status-variant cards
  - Row 2: Field Documents + Activity Log (side-by-side cards)
- **AI Copilot dock** — persistent fixed bottom bar available on all tabs
- **Status strip** — pill-shaped indicators with colored dots, dynamically updated
- **Customize panel** — right-side 420px slide-out with theme/scale/mode/sidebar/section toggles, persisted to localStorage
- Collapses on mobile (<900px) with hamburger toggle + overlay
- Theme switcher + alert bell + mode switcher in sidebar footer
- **Status strip** at top of content area: services count, inventory total, contacts, alerts, military time
- **LAN chat button** at left:260px (not 20px) to avoid covering sidebar footer
- `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` on every tab switch to prevent blank-space-at-top bug
- FABs (LAN Chat, Quick Actions, Timer) placed OUTSIDE `.container` div to prevent layout interference
- **UI Zoom** — 4 levels (Small 0.85x, Default 1x, Large 1.15x, X-Large 1.3x) via `html[data-zoom]` + CSS `--ui-zoom` variable + `html { font-size: calc(13px * var(--ui-zoom)) }`. Setting in Preferences, persists in localStorage.

## Service Ports
Dashboard: 8080, Ollama: 11434, Kiwix: 8888, CyberChef: 8889, FlatNotes: 8890, Kolibri: 8300, Qdrant: 6333, Stirling: 8443, Node Discovery: UDP 18080

## 12 Main Tabs
Situation Room (default landing), Home/Services, AI Chat, Library, Maps, Notes, Media, Tools, Preparedness, Benchmark, Settings (+ NukeMap opens in-app frame)

## Home Tab Layout (6 sections, top to bottom)
1. **Welcome / Getting Started** — first-run only, onboarding checklist
2. **Active Downloads** — unified download queue banner (auto-polling 5s)
3. **Search + Live Dashboard** — unified search bar + mode-aware widget grid (auto-refresh 30s, incl. sunrise/sunset)
4. **Readiness + Preparedness** — two-column: readiness score (left) + needs-by-category grid (right); stacks on <1000px
5. **AI Copilot** — quick-query input with voice + suggested actions panel
6. **Services** — section header with Start/Stop All buttons, quicklinks, full service grid
7. **Printable Field Documents** — collapsible `<details>`: 6 document cards (Operations Binder, Wallet Cards, SOI, Emergency Sheet, Medical Cards, Bug-Out List)
8. **Activity Log** — collapsible `<details>` with id `home-activity`: filterable event feed

## Media Tab (5 sub-tabs)
- **Browse Channels** — 210 survival channels across 26 categories, auto-hide dead channels
- **My Videos** — Upload/download/play instructional videos, thumbnail cards, watch+download player; **131 curated tutorial videos** across 14 folders
- **My Audio** — Audio catalog with favorites, batch operations, sorting; **102 training audio entries** across 13 folders
- **My Books** — EPUB/PDF reader, book catalog; **141 reference books** (archive.org/govt URLs) across 16 folders
- **Torrent Library** — Built-in BitTorrent client (libtorrent) with live progress UI; **152 curated torrent collections** across 12 categories (survival/maps/weather/radio/textbooks/medical/farming/videos/software/encyclopedias/repair/energy)

## 25 Preparedness Sub-Tabs (5 category groups)
- **Supplies**: Inventory, Fuel, Equipment, Ammo
- **People**: Contacts, Family Plan, Skills, Community, Journal
- **Readiness**: Checklists, Medical, Security, Power, Garden, Weather, Radiation
- **Knowledge**: Guides, Calculators (with search filter), Procedures, Radio, Quick Ref, Signals
- **Operations**: Command Post (SITREP, ICS forms), Secure Vault, Incidents

Category navigation: top row = 5 category buttons, bottom row = sub-tabs within selected category. `PREP_CATEGORIES` JS object maps categories to sub-tab arrays. `showPrepCategory(cat)` renders sub-tabs; `_findCategoryForSub(sub)` auto-detects category when navigating from widgets/search.

## Critical Gotchas
- **DECISION_GUIDES array**: ALL 21 guide objects must be inside the `];`. Placing objects after the closing bracket causes a JS syntax error that kills ALL interactivity.
- **`let` TDZ in workspace_memory.js** — `_app_workspace_memory.js` loads BEFORE `_app_situation_room.js`. Any `typeof _sitroomXxx !== 'undefined'` check on a `let`-declared variable throws `ReferenceError` (temporal dead zone), NOT `undefined`. Must use try-catch around sitroom variable access in workspace_memory. An uncaught TDZ error kills the ENTIRE inline `<script>` block, preventing all subsequent JS files from executing.
- **MapLibre v4.7.1 globe** — `setProjection({type: 'globe'})` does NOT exist in this build. 3D globe button hidden via CSS. Would need MapLibre v5+ for globe projection support.
- **escapeAttr function**: Contains HTML entities (`&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`, `&lt;`) which are correct — browsers do NOT decode entities inside `<script>` tags. Must escape single quotes too for onclick attributes.
- **FABs must be outside .container**: LAN Chat, Quick Actions, and Timer widgets (position:fixed) must be DOM siblings of .main-content, NOT inside .container.
- **scrollTo on tab switch**: Without `window.scrollTo(0,0)` in the tab click handler, switching from a scrolled-down tab leaves the viewport at the old scroll position.
- **Duplicate CSS removed**: Inline `<style>` in index.html now contains ONLY theme variables (8 lines). All component/layout CSS is in external app.css. Don't re-add inline CSS.
- **subprocess.PIPE with reader thread** — service Popen now uses PIPE+STDOUT for log capture, with a dedicated reader thread per service draining stdout into `_service_logs` ring buffer (500 lines). This avoids the 4KB pipe buffer deadlock. CyberChef (http.server) still uses DEVNULL since it's in-process.
- **Ollama OLLAMA_MODELS env var** — must always point to app's configured data dir. Kill any system Ollama on port 11434 before starting app's own instance
- **AI chat streaming** — must check `resp.ok` before calling `resp.body.getReader()`, otherwise 503 errors silently hang. Streaming render uses requestAnimationFrame to avoid jank.
- **DB connections** — prefer `db_session()` context manager from `db.py` (`with db_session() as db:`) for automatic close. All service files and app.py routes use try-finally on get_db(). SQLite timeout is 30s, FK enforcement ON. `teardown_appcontext` safety net auto-closes connections stored on `flask.g`.
- **Input validation** — int/float conversions on user input (ammo qty, fuel stabilizer, radiation dose) wrapped in try-except with fallback to 0. Harvest quantity forced >= 0.
- **Calculator tab init** — 30 calculator functions called on tab switch; wrapped in try-catch to prevent blank tab if any single calc fails.
- **Extra </div> tags** — psub sections can have extra closes that push settings tab outside .container. Always verify nesting after editing prep sub-tabs.
- **Cross-platform abstraction** — ALL platform-specific code goes through `platform_utils.py`. Never use `creationflags`, `os.startfile`, `ctypes.windll`, `powershell`, hardcoded `.exe` extensions, or `%APPDATA%` directly. Use `popen_kwargs()`, `run_kwargs()`, `exe_name()`, `open_folder()`, `find_pid_on_port()`, `get_data_base()` etc.
- **Config paths** — Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ProjectNOMAD/config.json`, Linux: `~/.config/ProjectNOMAD/config.json`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ProjectNOMAD/config.json`
- **Data paths** — Windows: `%APPDATA%/ProjectNOMAD`, Linux: `~/.local/share/ProjectNOMAD`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ProjectNOMAD`
- **Service download URLs** — each service module has a `_get_*_url()` function that returns platform-appropriate download URLs via `platform_utils`
- NukeMap: `/nukemap` redirects to `/nukemap/` (trailing slash for relative paths)
- PyInstaller: `_bootstrap()` must skip when `sys.frozen`
- **Sidebar sub-menus** — `.sidebar-sub[data-parent="tabname"]` divs toggled by `updateSidebarSubs()` which reads `.tab.active` dataset. Called on tab click via event listener. Sub-item onclick handlers use `scrollToSection(id)` which calls `el.scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth'})` after 200ms delay.
- **Prep categories** — `PREP_CATEGORIES` JS object is the single source of truth for category→sub-tab mapping. `switchPrepSub()` calls `_findCategoryForSub()` to auto-switch category. All 25 sub-tab loaders are now in the main `switchPrepSub()` function (no more `_origSwitchPrepSub` wrapper).
- **UI zoom** — `setUIZoom(level)` sets `data-zoom` attribute on `<html>` + localStorage. CSS rule `html { font-size: calc(13px * var(--ui-zoom)) }` cascades through entire UI. Zoom levels: small=0.85, default=1, large=1.15, xlarge=1.3.
- **yt-dlp auto-install** — `browseChannelVideos()` detects "not installed" error and shows install button that calls `autoInstallYtdlp()`, which POSTs to `/api/ytdlp/install`, polls status every 2s, then auto-retries the browse on success.
- **routes_advanced.py** — advanced routes (phases 16-20) in separate file, registered via `register_advanced_routes(app)` called before `return app` in `create_app()`. Contains AI SITREP, AI actions, AI memory, operations binder, wallet cards, SOI, DB health, self-test, undo system, community readiness, skill search, alert relay.
- DB migrations must run BEFORE index creation
- json.loads from DB needs `or '{}'` / `or '[]'` fallback for NULL values
- Kiwix won't start without ZIM files
- Qdrant uses env var not CLI arg for storage path
- Planet PMTiles URL: `https://data.source.coop/protomaps/openstreetmap/v4.pmtiles` (build.protomaps.com is dead)
- `switchPrepSub` is overridden at bottom of script to auto-load new tab data; override must come AFTER original definition
- `switchPrepSub` override must call `loadChecklists()` for 'checklists' sub — it doesn't auto-load from the original function
- Readiness score factors in: ammo (security), fuel (shelter/power), skills proficiency (planning), trusted community members (planning)
- Equipment `markServiced()` sends full record with updated last_service + status='operational' via PUT
- **Do NOT redefine `formatBytes`** — defined once near line 6118; a second definition silently shadows it with broken behavior (<1024 returns "0 KB")
- **Service process registration** — service modules MUST use `register_process()` / `unregister_process()` from manager.py, NEVER directly mutate `_processes` dict (thread safety)
- **Path traversal on Windows** — always use `os.path.normcase()` on BOTH sides of `startswith` checks (Windows paths are case-insensitive)
- **Config writes** — config.py uses atomic write (tmp file + os.replace) to prevent corruption on crash. Config reads are mtime-cached — `load_config()` only re-reads disk when file changes. Cache auto-invalidated on `save_config()`.
- **Health monitor grace period** — 90 seconds before first check to let auto_start_services finish (Stirling can take 60s+)
- **Service health checks** — `manager.is_healthy(service_id)` checks PID alive AND HTTP health endpoint via `SERVICE_HEALTH_URLS`. Use instead of `is_running()` when you need to verify the service is actually responding.
- **wait_for_port** — `manager.wait_for_port(port, timeout, interval)` blocks until port accepts connections. Use in service `start()` functions instead of manual sleep loops.
- **Log rotation** — `nomad.py` uses `RotatingFileHandler` (5 MB max, 3 backups). Log files: `nomad.log`, `nomad.log.1`, `nomad.log.2`, `nomad.log.3`.
- **AI context helpers** — `build_situation_context(db)` returns list of context sections from DB (inventory, contacts, patients, fuel, ammo, equipment, alerts, weather, power, incidents). `get_ai_memory_text()` loads AI memory facts. `_safe_json_list(val)` parses JSON with fallback. All defined inside `create_app()` in app.py.
- **Global error handler** — `@app.errorhandler(Exception)` returns JSON `{'error': ...}` for `/api/` routes. Non-API routes re-raise for Flask's default HTML handler.
- **Ollama chat errors** — `ollama.chat()` raises descriptive `RuntimeError` for ConnectionError ("AI service not running"), Timeout ("request timed out"), and 404 ("Model not found"). Callers should catch `RuntimeError` for user-friendly messages.
- **Sync-receive column validation** — must validate column names against PRAGMA table_info before INSERT (SQL injection prevention)
- **PMTiles serving** — must stream large files in chunks, NEVER read() entire file into memory (can be GB+)
- **Night mode** — uses `_nightModeApplied` flag to only trigger once per day/night transition, not fight manual theme changes

## UX Design Principles
- All jargon removed — plain English throughout (no Ollama/Kiwix/PMTiles/Sneakernet)
- Download sizes shown on all install/download buttons
- Empty states with helpful guidance on every panel
- Contextual help icons (?) linking to relevant user guide sections
- System presets grouped by category in dropdown
- Prep sub-tabs ordered by emergency priority (Inventory first)
- Quick-add templates for 58 common inventory items across 8 categories
- Status strip shows key metrics at a glance (military time format)
- Debounced search inputs (media filter, channel filter) at 200ms
- Error feedback on destructive actions (map delete, vault delete, model delete)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+K (search), Ctrl+/ (copilot), Alt+1-9 (tab switch), Escape (close modals), ? (shortcut help)
- 3 dashboard modes: Command Center, Homestead, Essentials — each with tailored sidebar ordering, widget sets, and copilot suggestions
